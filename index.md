Hey! I am currently a postdoc in the [Algebra Group](http://www.math.muni.cz/~bourkej/BAS.html) in the Department for Mathematics and Statistics at [Masaryk University](https://www.math.muni.cz/english/) in Brno, CZ. Before that I was a PhD student supervised by [Nicola Gambino](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtng/) at the School of Mathematics, University of Leeds. I defended my thesis ["Pseudomonads, Relative Monads and Strongly Finitary Notions of Multicategory"](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/30578/) in February 2022. Here you can find my [cv](Gabriele_Lobbia_CV.pdf) and my [Google Scholar account](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xjHu2moAAAAJ&hl=it).

My research interests are in category theory, logic and algebra. More precisely, I mainly work on low dimensional category theory, monad theory and skew structures (monoidal, multicategories...). 

## ItaCa
I volunteer as social media manager for [ItaCa](https://progetto-itaca.github.io/), the Italian community of Category theorists.
